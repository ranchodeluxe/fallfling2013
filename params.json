{"name":"A HowTo About A HowTo: The Python GDAL/OGR Cookbook","tagline":"CUGOS 2013 Fall Fling Smackdown","body":"# Welcome to the Smackdown!\r\nLet's learn how we can use [Pierce County's awesome Python GDAL/OGR Cookbook](http://pcjericks.github.io/py-gdalogr-cookbook/). But first, let's install a bunch of junk on your computer if it's not already there.\r\n\r\n## Tooling, Installs, Data\r\nSome of the tools we'll use today to explore the cookbook include:\r\n\r\n0. **Shell**  # Windows people can use CMD, PowerShell or GitBash ( see below )\r\n1. **Python**\r\n2. **GDAL/OGR Library and Python Bindings**\r\n3. [Mapfart.bom](http://mapfart.com) or **QGIS**  # to visualize the input/outputs\r\n4. **PostGIS**  # if you care about database support\r\n5. **Shapefiles**  # i got mine from [King County GIS Portal](http://www5.kingcounty.gov/gisdataportal/Default.aspx)\r\n\r\nWe will **not** be walking people through installs. Installs depend on the operating system you are running among other factors. So here's a list of places to get started depending on your operating system:\r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\nThere's no particular reason to use [GitBash](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=label:Featured)  these examples. Using CMD or PowerShell in Windows is fine. Most of the time we will just be running `python` commands. But sometimes we might be running commands that look unfamiliar. If you want to explore a Linux-type shell environment than [GitBash](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=label:Featured) is a good place to start\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Mac\r\n\r\n#### Linux ( Debian and Ubuntu )\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
